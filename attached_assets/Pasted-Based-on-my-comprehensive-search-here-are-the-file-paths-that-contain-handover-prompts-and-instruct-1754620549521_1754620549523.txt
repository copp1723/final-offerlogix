üéØ SUMMARY
The handover system is fully implemented with prompts and instructions distributed across:

8 main configuration files for UI components
3 core service files for backend logic
Multiple agent modules with specific handover triggers
Database schema for persistent storage
Test files with working examples
The handover prompts are not centralized in a single file but are distributed across the component architecture where they're used, which is actually a good architectural pattern for maintainability.
