Got it — you want the conversion-ready handover brief to be leaner, sharper, and bullet-driven so a sales rep can scan it in 5 seconds and know exactly what to do.

Here’s the streamlined final format you can drop into your HandoverService pipeline.

Automotive Handover – Bullet-Action Format

{
  "name": "Customer Name",
  "modified_name": "Preferred Name",
  "user_query": "Exact last customer message",
  "quick_insights": [
    "Vehicle: make/model/trim",
    "Motivator: price, features, trade, financing",
    "Timeline: now / 30 days / later",
    "Any blockers or constraints"
  ],
  "actions": [
    "Confirm inventory match",
    "Offer similar options if OOS",
    "Schedule test drive or call",
    "Send trade-in link if relevant",
    "Direct to finance if requested"
  ],
  "sales_readiness": "low | medium | high",
  "priority": "standard | immediate",
  "rep_message": "Short, rep-ready follow-up message to send now",
  "research_queries": ["Exact inventory or offer lookups"],
  "reply_required": true
}

Example – High Intent Truck Lead

{
  "name": "Jonathan Smith",
  "modified_name": "Jon",
  "user_query": "Do you have the 2023 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road in black available for immediate delivery?",
  "quick_insights": [
    "Vehicle: 2023 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road, black",
    "Motivator: Immediate delivery",
    "Timeline: Now",
    "No trade-in or financing info yet"
  ],
  "actions": [
    "Check stock for exact trim/color",
    "Offer similar trims/colors if OOS",
    "Hold vehicle with refundable deposit",
    "Ask about trade-in",
    "Check if financing needed"
  ],
  "sales_readiness": "high",
  "priority": "immediate",
  "rep_message": "Jon, I can confirm the black TRD Off-Road today and reserve it for you. Want me to check both in-stock and inbound?",
  "research_queries": [
    "2023 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road black in-stock or inbound for immediate delivery"
  ],
  "reply_required": true
}

Why This Works for Reps
	•	Top-Loaded Critical Info: First thing they see is who, what, and urgency.
	•	No Wall of Text: Insights are ≤4 bullets.
	•	Action List = To-Do: They can literally check them off.
	•	Rep Message = Copy-Paste Ready: One line, natural, no editing.
	•	Priority Field: Lets your notification system decide if this is an email or an SMS/Slack ping.

If you want, I can now write the generateSalesBrief() method that:
	1.	Pulls ConversationAnalysis data from HandoverService
	2.	Fills this template automatically
	3.	Validates it with Zod/Yup before sending to the human

That way, every handover output is this exact bullet-action format — no more guesswork or rewriting.

Do you want me to build that function next?
