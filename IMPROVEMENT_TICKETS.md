## HIGH PRIORITY - WEEK 1-2

### Ticket #001: Conversation Context Retention
**Priority**: Critical  
**Impact**: 40% better lead engagement  
**Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)

- Store conversation context in Redis for fast retrieval

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] AI responses reference previous messages
- [ ] Context includes last 5 messages max (performance)
- [ ] Conversation flows naturally without repetition
- [ ] Performance impact < 200ms per response

**Files to Modify**:
- `server/services/conversation-responder.ts`

### Ticket #002: Lead Scoring System

- Threshold-based handover triggers (score > 75 = immediate, 50-75 = scheduled, <50 = continue AI)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Scoring algorithm implemented with configurable weights
- [ ] Lead scores stored and tracked over time
- [ ] Handover thresholds configurable per campaign

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Generate 2-3 template variations per campaign
