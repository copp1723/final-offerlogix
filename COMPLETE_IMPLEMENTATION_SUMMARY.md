## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **1. Campaign Creation with Rule Mode**
1. Go to `/campaigns/new`
2. Set Handover Mode to "Rule-Based + AI Fallback"
3. Add keywords: "price", "payment", "finance"

### **3. Sales Team Workflow**
1. Visit `/handovers` dashboard
2. See pending handovers with urgency indicators
3. Click "View Brief" to see detailed intelligence
4. Use sales strategies and closing recommendations
