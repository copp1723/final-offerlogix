I work with OfferLogix and noticed your dealership's online presence. We help automotive dealers ensure their payment calculations are accurate and compliant across all platforms - website, ads, CRM.

Many dealers we work with were struggling with:
- Payment calculations that didn't match between their website and ads
- Compliance headaches across different states  
- Time wasted manually updating payments when rates changed

We've automated this for 8,000+ stores with our single-call API. Dealers typically see better lead quality and fewer compliance issues.

Quick question - how are you currently handling payment calculations for your online advertising?

Best,
Brittany

Quick follow-up from my previous email about payment advertising.

I was looking at your current inventory online and wondering - when your rates change or you add new vehicles, how long does it take to update all your payment displays?

Most dealers tell us it's a manual process that takes hours and often has errors. We've solved this for dealers by automating accurate, compliant payments across all platforms.

For example, one dealer group went from 4 hours of manual updates to instant, automatic updates across 12 locations.

Would something like that be helpful for your operation?

        subject: "Payment compliance - quick reality check",
        content: `{{firstName}},

Hope you don't mind me reaching out again. I'm curious about something specific.

How confident are you that your current payment ads are 100% compliant across all the states where you advertise?

I ask because we just helped a dealer avoid a $50,000 compliance fine. Their payment calculations were off by a few dollars, but that was enough to trigger regulatory issues.

Our system automatically handles compliance across all 50 states. Takes that worry off the table completely.

Worth a quick conversation?

      {
        subject: "Your competition is doing this (payment advertising)",
        content: `{{firstName}},

I probably shouldn't tell you this, but several dealerships in your area are already using our payment automation system.

They're advertising accurate, compliant payments that update automatically when rates change. While their competitors are still doing manual calculations (with errors), they're capturing higher-quality leads.

The difference in lead volume has been significant - typically 30-40% increases in qualified prospects.

I'd hate for you to get left behind on this. Want to see how it works?

        subject: "Last note on payment advertising automation",
        content: `{{firstName}},

I know I've reached out a few times about automating your payment calculations. This will be my last email unless I hear from you.

Just wanted to share one final thought: every day you're manually calculating payments is a day you could be doing more strategic work for your dealership.

Our clients save 10-15 hours per week on payment updates alone. That's time they can spend with customers, analyzing performance, or growing the business.

If you ever want to see how this works, I'm here. Otherwise, I respect your time and won't reach out again.

All the best,
Brittany
