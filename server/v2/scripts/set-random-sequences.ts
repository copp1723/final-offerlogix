  `Hi [firstName],
SUVs are commanding top dollar. We're adding up to $2K in trade assist to keep them flowing.
If you've got a 2018‚Äì2022 SUV, this is the time to find out what it's really worth.
Want me to get you a number?`,

  `[FirstName],
We've had SUV owners walk in expecting one value and leave with something much higher.
Right now, we're stacking an extra $2K on qualifying trades.
Would you like me to send you your SUV's current value?`,

  `Hi [firstName],
The SUV trade assist is tied to supply. Once inventory loosens, it's gone.
If you've been thinking about moving your SUV, this is the time to act.
Want me to pull your value today?`,

  `[FirstName],
Here's the truth: SUVs are worth more right now.
We're adding up to $2K trade assist on top of normal value.
Want the real number for yours?`,

  `Hi [firstName],
If you've already traded, ignore this.
If not ‚Äî the $2K trade assist is still running today.
Do you want me to send you your updated number?`,

  `[FirstName],
This is the last message on the SUV program. The $2K bonus ends once supply catches up.
If you own a 2018‚Äì2022 SUV, now's the final chance to lock in that value.
Want me to run the numbers before it's gone?`
