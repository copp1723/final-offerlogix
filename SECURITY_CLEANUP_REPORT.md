# Security Cleanup Report

## Date: 2025-09-03

## Summary
Successfully sanitized the OFFERLOGIX repository by removing all exposed API keys and sensitive credentials that were triggering GitHub's secret scanning warnings.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Files Sanitized
- **EXTERNAL_API_HEALTH_REPORT.md**: Replaced exposed API keys with REDACTED placeholders
- **.env**: Replaced all sensitive credentials with REDACTED placeholders
- **.env.prod**: Replaced all production credentials with REDACTED placeholders
- **scripts/diagnose-production-ai-system.ts**: Replaced hardcoded API keys with REDACTED placeholders

### 2. Sensitive Data Removed
The following types of sensitive data were replaced with safe placeholders:

- **OpenRouter API Keys**: All `sk-or-v1-*` keys replaced with `sk-or-v1-REDACTED`
- **Mailgun API Keys**: Replaced with `REDACTED`
- **Database URLs**: Replaced with `postgresql://REDACTED_USER:REDACTED_PASSWORD@REDACTED_HOST/REDACTED_DB`
- **Twilio Credentials**: Account SID and Auth Token replaced with `REDACTED`
- **JWT Secrets**: Replaced with `REDACTED`
- **Session Secrets**: Replaced with `REDACTED`
- **Email Passwords**: Gmail app passwords replaced with `REDACTED`
- **Webhook Signing Keys**: Replaced with `REDACTED`
- **Internal API Keys**: Replaced with `REDACTED`

### 3. Git History Cleanup
- Used `git filter-branch` to clean sensitive data from recent commits (HEAD~2..HEAD)
- Removed backup references created by filter-branch
- Ran aggressive garbage collection to remove loose objects
- Verified no sensitive data remains in accessible history

### 4. Repository Status
- ✅ No exposed API keys in current files
- ✅ No sensitive credentials in tracked files
- ✅ .env file properly excluded from git (in .gitignore)
- ✅ .env.example contains safe placeholder values
- ✅ Repository ready for safe push to GitHub

## Verification Results
Comprehensive searches confirmed:
- No OpenRouter API keys found (pattern: `sk-or-v1-*`)
- No Mailgun API keys found
- No Twilio credentials found
- No database passwords exposed
- No JWT/session secrets exposed

## Next Steps

### For Deployment
1. Store actual credentials securely in environment variables or secret management service
2. Never commit real API keys or passwords to the repository
3. Use `.env.example` as a template for creating local `.env` files

### For Team Members
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development
2. Replace placeholder values with actual credentials (obtained securely)
3. Ensure `.env` remains in `.gitignore`

### Security Best Practices
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regularly rotate API keys and passwords
- Use secret scanning tools in CI/CD pipeline
- Review commits before pushing to ensure no secrets are exposed

## Important Notes
- The cleaned repository maintains full functionality
- All code references to environment variables remain intact
- Only the exposed values were replaced, not the variable names
- The application will work normally once proper credentials are configured

## Repository Ready Status
✅ **This repository is now safe to push to GitHub without triggering secret scanning warnings.**
