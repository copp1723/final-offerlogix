For complete API documentation, see [API Reference](./API.md).

## Usage Examples

### Processing Customer Messages

```typescript
// When a customer sends a message
const customerMessage = "I'm looking for a reliable truck for my business";

// Process through the intelligence pipeline
const result = await conversationIntelligenceHub.processConversation(
  conversationId,
  customerMessage,
  'customer-123'
);

// Get the AI-powered response
const response = result.response.content;
// "Thank you for your interest! For business use, I'd recommend our commercial truck lineup. What type of work will you be using the truck for?"

// Check for buying signals
const signals = result.analysis.buyingSignals.signals;
// [{ signal: "business", confidence: 85, strength: "moderate" }]

// Get coaching suggestions
const coaching = result.coaching.suggestions;
// [{ type: "opportunity_highlight", title: "Commercial Lead Detected", action: "Focus on business benefits" }]
```

### Setting Up A/B Tests

```typescript
// Create an A/B test for response optimization
const testId = await conversationIntelligenceHub.createConversationABTest(
  "Response Tone Test",
  "Testing professional vs friendly tone",
  [
    {
      name: "Professional Tone",
      weight: 50,
      responseParameters: {
        tone: "professional",
        personalizationLevel: "moderate"
      }
    },
    {
      name: "Friendly Tone", 
      weight: 50,
      responseParameters: {
        tone: "friendly",
        personalizationLevel: "high"
      }
    }
  ]
);

// Start the test
await responseQualityOptimizer.startABTest(testId);
```

### Real-time Coaching Integration

```typescript
// Get real-time coaching for an active conversation
const coaching = await conversationIntelligenceHub.getRealtimeCoaching(conversationId);

// Display urgent alerts to agents
coaching.urgentAlerts.forEach(alert => {
  if (alert.priority === 'critical') {
    displayAlert(alert.title, alert.description, alert.suggestedAction);
  }
});

// Show response guidance
coaching.responseGuidance.forEach(guidance => {
  showGuidance(guidance.suggestedAction, guidance.expectedOutcome);
});
```

## Configuration

### Automotive Knowledge Base

The system includes a comprehensive automotive knowledge base that can be customized:

```typescript
// Example: Customizing vehicle-specific responses
const customKnowledge = {
  vehicleTypes: {
    electric: {
      features: ['zero emissions', 'instant torque', 'quiet operation'],
      benefits: ['environmental friendly', 'lower operating costs'],
      commonQuestions: ['charging time', 'range', 'charging stations'],
      sellingPoints: ['government incentives', 'technology leadership']
    }
  }
};
```

### Response Quality Thresholds

```typescript
// Configure quality scoring thresholds
const qualityConfig = {
  minimumScore: 70,
  escalationThreshold: 80,
  personalizationWeight: 0.25,
  automotiveExpertiseWeight: 0.30
};
```

### A/B Testing Configuration

```typescript
// A/B test configuration
const testConfig = {
  requiredSampleSize: 100,
  confidenceLevel: 95,
  segmentation: {
    leadScore: { min: 70, max: 100 }, // Only test on high-quality leads
    vehicleInterest: ['truck', 'suv'] // Focus on specific vehicle types
  }
};
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive metrics:

- **Response Quality Score**: Overall quality of AI-generated responses (0-100)
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of conversations leading to sales
- **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of conversations escalated to humans
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Inferred satisfaction based on conversation flow
- **Response Time**: Average time to generate responses
- **Coaching Implementation Rate**: How often agents follow coaching suggestions

### Dashboard Integration

```typescript
// Get dashboard data for monitoring
const dashboardData = await conversationIntelligenceHub.getDashboardData({
  start: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  end: new Date('2024-12-31')
});

// Display key metrics
console.log(`Average Quality Score: ${dashboardData.overview.averageQualityScore}`);
console.log(`Conversion Rate: ${dashboardData.overview.conversionRate}%`);
console.log(`Active A/B Tests: ${dashboardData.optimizationImpact.activeTests}`);
```

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
// Monitor service health
const health = conversationIntelligenceHub.getServiceHealth();

if (health.status !== 'healthy') {
  console.warn('Conversation Intelligence services degraded:', health.services);
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Conversation Processing

- **Process All Customer Messages**: Ensure every customer message goes through the intelligence pipeline
- **Use Context**: Always provide complete conversation context for best results
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement fallback responses for system errors

### 2. Coaching Implementation

- **Real-time Alerts**: Display critical coaching alerts immediately to agents
- **Training Integration**: Use coaching suggestions for agent training programs
- **Feedback Loop**: Track which coaching suggestions lead to better outcomes

### 3. A/B Testing

- **Statistical Significance**: Ensure adequate sample sizes before drawing conclusions
- **Segment Appropriately**: Test different strategies for different customer segments
- **Monitor Continuously**: Track test results and implement winning strategies

### 4. Quality Optimization

- **Regular Review**: Periodically review response quality scores and optimization opportunities
- **Personalization**: Leverage personalization profiles for different customer segments
- **Continuous Learning**: Use successful conversation patterns to improve future responses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Low Response Quality Scores**
   - Check if automotive knowledge base is properly configured
   - Verify OpenAI API is functioning correctly
   - Review conversation context completeness

2. **A/B Test Not Starting**
   - Ensure variant weights sum to 100%
   - Check required sample size is reasonable (>50)
   - Verify segmentation criteria match available leads

3. **Coaching Suggestions Not Appearing**
   - Confirm conversation has sufficient message history
   - Check if conversation analysis completed successfully
   - Verify coaching thresholds are appropriate

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```typescript
// Enable debug mode
process.env.CONVERSATION_INTELLIGENCE_DEBUG = 'true';

// View detailed processing logs
const result = await conversationIntelligenceHub.processConversation(
  conversationId,
  message,
  senderId
);
```

### Performance Optimization

For high-volume deployments:

1. **Caching**: Enable response caching for similar messages
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple conversations simultaneously
3. **Service Scaling**: Scale individual services based on load
4. **Database Optimization**: Optimize conversation and lead queries
