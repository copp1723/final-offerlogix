### 2. Audience Analysis
Understand your target audience before campaign creation:

## AI Campaign Agent Interaction

### 1. Initial Campaign Request
Engage the AI Campaign Agent with clear, detailed requests:

```

**Detailed Request:**
```
"I need a 3-week re-engagement campaign for leads who showed interest in SUVs 6 months ago but haven't responded recently. Focus on new Explorer features, current incentives, and competitive advantages. Include trade-in value messaging and emphasize family safety features."
```

**Complex Multi-Objective Request:**
```
"Design a comprehensive campaign for our model year-end clearance that targets both new vehicle sales and service upsells. Primary focus on 2024 inventory clearance with special financing, secondary focus on extended warranty and service packages. Segment by vehicle type with different messaging for truck vs. car buyers. Include competitive comparison elements and urgency messaging for limited-time offers."

- Subject line: 'Final Hours: Your F-150 Special Expires Tonight'
- Countdown timer in email content
- Limited inventory messaging
- Exclusive final incentive for immediate action
- Direct phone number for urgent inquiries"
```

**Audience Modification:**
