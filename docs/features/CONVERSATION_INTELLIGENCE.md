# Conversation Intelligence System

OneKeel Swarm's Conversation Intelligence transforms customer interactions through AI-powered response management, quality scoring, and memory-augmented personalization that maintains consistent, high-quality conversations at scale.

- Vehicle interest evolution over time
- Previous campaign responses and engagement
- Purchase behavior patterns and preferences

**Intelligent Context Application:**
- Relevant history injection into current conversations
- Pattern recognition for personalized responses
- Preference learning and adaptation
- Conversation continuity across sessions

**Privacy-Protected Memory:**
