# 🚀 Campaign Launch Ready - Issues Resolved

## ✅ **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### **Issue 1: Email Delivery Failure - FIXED**
**Problem**: Emails to `campaigns@kunesmacomb.kunesauto.vip` were being rejected with "550 5.0.1 Recipient rejected"

**Root Cause**: Missing Mailgun route for the `campaigns@` email address

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Created Mailgun route: `match_recipient("campaigns@kunesmacomb.kunesauto.vip")`
- ✅ Created wildcard route: `match_recipient(".*@kunesmacomb.kunesauto.vip")`
- ✅ Both routes forward to: `https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com/api/webhooks/mailgun/inbound`
- ✅ Test email sent successfully (Message ID: `<20250826154602.d966006bdb8cae78@mg.watchdogai.us>`)

### **Issue 2: Webhook Authentication - WORKING**
**Problem**: Webhook endpoint returning "401 Unauthorized" errors

**Root Cause**: Signature verification was working correctly - the 401 errors were from invalid/test requests

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ Valid signatures: Accepted (202 - processed correctly)
- ✅ Invalid signatures: Rejected (401 - security working)
- ✅ Signing key configured correctly: `31420435...`
- ✅ Webhook endpoint accessible and responding
